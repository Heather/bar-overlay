Actually, old ebuilds without the core/drivers spliting used to be mergeable
with -servicetools -gtk. cnijfilter-4.[01]0 changed it a little bit because
+gtk build now but the same old code in 'cngpijmon' and 'cngpmnt' present only
in cnijfilter-3.[89]0 ported, or to be precise copied 'as is' I think, to
'cnijnpr' in cnijfilter-4.[01]0 do not compile and throw the same (old) errors! 

So cnijfilter-{2.[6-9],3.[0-9]}0[-servicetools,-gtk] is compilable while
cnijfilter-4.[01]0[-servicetools] compile with +gtk! 

I don't really know where the whole old code in 'cngpijmon' present in old
tarball went in cnijfilter-4.x0 nor the 'maintenace' present in the last 3.x0.
It seems 'cngpijmon/cnijnpr' was moved and lgmon API changed because there is a
new lgmon2 in 4.x0 while many chunk of code where left 'as is' which are not
compilable since the old days!

For the drivers ebuild cnijfilter-drivers-2.[67]0[abi_x86_32,-gtk] compile just
fine and cnijfilter-drivers-[0-4].x0[abi_x86_32,gtk] compile as well, while
the latter version support multilib and compile with +gtk.
The oddity of the very old drivers is a dependency to gtk+:1. So uless you have
it installed, it is imposile to pass src_prepare ecause aclocal fails on a
missing AM GTK MACRO (with dep to >=gtk+-1.2.6:1).
