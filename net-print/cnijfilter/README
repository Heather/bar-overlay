Note: removed splitting core/drivers ebuilds and eclass bits because...
splitting is impossible since canon include printer model/ids in the common
backend (usb+net). So, it is impossible to do so!


Actually, old ebuilds used to be mergeable with -servicetools -gtk. Alghough
cnijfilter-4.[01]0 changed it a little bit because now +gtk build, however,
the same old code in 'cngpijmon' and 'cngpmnt' present only in cnijfilter-3.[89]0
ported, or to be precise copied 'as is' I think, to 'cnijnpr' in cnijfilter-4.[01]0
do not compile and throw the same (old) errors! 

So cnijfilter-{2.[6-9],3.[0-9]}0[-servicetools,-gtk] is compilable while
cnijfilter-4.[01]0[-servicetools,+gtk] compile just fine! 

I don't really know where the whole old code in 'cngpijmon' present in old
tarball went in cnijfilter-4.x0 nor the 'maintenace' present in the last 3.x0.
It seems 'cngpijmon/cnijnpr' was moved and lgmon API changed because there is a
new lgmon2 in 4.x0 while many chunk of code where left 'as is' which are not
compilable since the old days!

The oddity of the very old drivers is a dependency to gtk+:1. So unless you have
it installed, it is imposile to pass src_prepare because aclocal fails on a
missing AM GTK MACRO (with dep to >=gtk+-1.2.6:1).
