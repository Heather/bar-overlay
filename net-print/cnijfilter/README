NEWS: 

added a new splitting CUPS backends+filters/drivers with USE flags instead of
a messy multiple packages implementation which needed messy back ports and much,
well, not easy to maintain.

To avoid the splitting cruft, just added the follong in `/etc/portage/package.use':
`=net-print/cnijfilter-${PV} backends drivers <driver names>'

Of course, you need to check drivers/package-version before hand. Or else...
`emerge' would prompt you to chose, at least, a driver and pull in the latest
version available and prompt you to enale `backends' USE flag for it! In this
case, you have to disable `drivers' USE flag if need be, because it is enabled
by defaut!,or else... you will be prompted to chose... a driver at least.

Wait a sec before merging the package! If you need old drivers present in
`<net-print/cnijfilter-3.40', you should add `abi_x86_32' if running with
`ABI=amd64' because these packages lack any multilib support. `x86' users can
jump to the following.

If one need `<net-print/cnijfilter-2.80', then x86 users would pull in `gtk+:1'
and amd64 user would pull in `gtk+:1[abi_x86_32]' which is not available in the
tree, meaning: impossible for `ABI=amd64'.

MORE DETAILS:

Actually, old ebuilds used to be mergeable with -servicetools -gtk. Alghough
cnijfilter-4.[01]0 changed it a little bit because now +gtk build, however,
the same old code in 'cngpijmon' and 'cngpmnt' present only in cnijfilter-3.[89]0
ported, or to be precise copied 'as is' I think, to 'cnijnpr' in cnijfilter-4.[01]0
do not compile and throw the same (old) errors! 

So cnijfilter-{2.[6-9],3.[0-9]}0[-servicetools,-gtk] is compilable while
cnijfilter-4.[01]0[-servicetools,+gtk] compile just fine! 

I don't really know where the whole old code in 'cngpijmon' present in old
tarball went in cnijfilter-4.x0 nor the 'maintenace' present in the last 3.x0.
It seems 'cngpijmon/cnijnpr' was moved and lgmon API changed because there is a
new lgmon2 in 4.x0 while many chunk of code where left 'as is' which are not
compilable since the old days!

The oddity of the very old drivers is a dependency to gtk+:1. So unless you have
it installed, it is imposile to pass src_prepare because aclocal fails on a
missing AM GTK MACRO (with dep to >=gtk+-1.2.6:1).

Note: if 2.70 src rpm cannot be bound, dead link..., just search the full name
wihh your favorite search engine, or else, look for Linux_Print_Filterv270.tgz
and extract cnijfilter-common-2.70-2.src.rpm from that archive.
