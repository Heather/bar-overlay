*2011-08-26:
	important update since commit 1c2e82bdefa3bec39891 (2011-08-22) EGIT_COMMIT were
	commented out as EGIT_TAG should have been enough to switch to the right bracnh,
	but alas it was not the case. git-2.eclass required a fix for that which is 
	already done. however, EGIT_COMMIT were commented in again as without those,
	the stable branch could not be merged with official portage git-2.eclass and even
	with EGIT_COMMIT in again, it might be impossible to merge the stable branch.
